        <LINE>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</LINE>
        
        <LINE>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</LINE>
        
        <LINE>Leap in with me into this angry flood,</LINE>

        <LINE>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</LINE>
        
        <LINE>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</LINE>
        
        <LINE>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</LINE>
        
        <LINE>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</LINE>
        
        <LINE>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</LINE>
        
        <LINE>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</LINE>
        
        <LINE>A wretched creature and must bend his body,</LINE>
        
        <LINE>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</LINE>
        
        <LINE>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</LINE>
        
        <LINE>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</LINE>

        <LINE>His coward lips did from their colour fly,</LINE>

        <LINE>Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</LINE>

        <LINE>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</LINE>
        
        <LINE>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</LINE>

        <LINE>neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told</LINE>

        <LINE>but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his</LINE>
