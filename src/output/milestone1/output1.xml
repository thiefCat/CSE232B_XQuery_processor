    <LINE>Will you go see the order of the course?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Not I.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I pray you, do.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I am not gamesome: I do lack some part</LINE>
    <LINE>Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.</LINE>
    <LINE>Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;</LINE>
    <LINE>I'll leave you.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Brutus, I do observe you now of late:</LINE>
    <LINE>I have not from your eyes that gentleness</LINE>
    <LINE>And show of love as I was wont to have:</LINE>
    <LINE>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</LINE>
    <LINE>Over your friend that loves you.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Cassius,</LINE>
    <LINE>Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,</LINE>
    <LINE>I turn the trouble of my countenance</LINE>
    <LINE>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</LINE>
    <LINE>Of late with passions of some difference,</LINE>
    <LINE>Conceptions only proper to myself,</LINE>
    <LINE>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</LINE>
    <LINE>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--</LINE>
    <LINE>Among which number, Cassius, be you one--</LINE>
    <LINE>Nor construe any further my neglect,</LINE>
    <LINE>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</LINE>
    <LINE>Forgets the shows of love to other men.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;</LINE>
    <LINE>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</LINE>
    <LINE>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</LINE>
    <LINE>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,</LINE>
    <LINE>But by reflection, by some other things.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>'Tis just:</LINE>
    <LINE>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</LINE>
    <LINE>That you have no such mirrors as will turn</LINE>
    <LINE>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</LINE>
    <LINE>That you might see your shadow. I have heard,</LINE>
    <LINE>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</LINE>
    <LINE>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</LINE>
    <LINE>And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</LINE>
    <LINE>Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</LINE>
    <LINE>That you would have me seek into myself</LINE>
    <LINE>For that which is not in me?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:</LINE>
    <LINE>And since you know you cannot see yourself</LINE>
    <LINE>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</LINE>
    <LINE>Will modestly discover to yourself</LINE>
    <LINE>That of yourself which you yet know not of.</LINE>
    <LINE>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</LINE>
    <LINE>Were I a common laugher, or did use</LINE>
    <LINE>To stale with ordinary oaths my love</LINE>
    <LINE>To every new protester; if you know</LINE>
    <LINE>That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</LINE>
    <LINE>And after scandal them, or if you know</LINE>
    <LINE>That I profess myself in banqueting</LINE>
    <LINE>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <STAGEDIR>Flourish, and shout</STAGEDIR>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>What means this shouting? I do fear, the people</LINE>
    <LINE>Choose Caesar for their king.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Ay, do you fear it?</LINE>
    <LINE>Then must I think you would not have it so.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.</LINE>
    <LINE>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</LINE>
    <LINE>What is it that you would impart to me?</LINE>
    <LINE>If it be aught toward the general good,</LINE>
    <LINE>Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,</LINE>
    <LINE>And I will look on both indifferently,</LINE>
    <LINE>For let the gods so speed me as I love</LINE>
    <LINE>The name of honour more than I fear death.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</LINE>
    <LINE>As well as I do know your outward favour.</LINE>
    <LINE>Well, honour is the subject of my story.</LINE>
    <LINE>I cannot tell what you and other men</LINE>
    <LINE>Think of this life; but, for my single self,</LINE>
    <LINE>I had as lief not be as live to be</LINE>
    <LINE>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</LINE>
    <LINE>I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</LINE>
    <LINE>We both have fed as well, and we can both</LINE>
    <LINE>Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</LINE>
    <LINE>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</LINE>
    <LINE>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</LINE>
    <LINE>Leap in with me into this angry flood,</LINE>
    <LINE>And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</LINE>
    <LINE>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</LINE>
    <LINE>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</LINE>
    <LINE>The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</LINE>
    <LINE>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</LINE>
    <LINE>And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</LINE>
    <LINE>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</LINE>
    <LINE>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</LINE>
    <LINE>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</LINE>
    <LINE>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</LINE>
    <LINE>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</LINE>
    <LINE>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</LINE>
    <LINE>A wretched creature and must bend his body,</LINE>
    <LINE>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</LINE>
    <LINE>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</LINE>
    <LINE>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</LINE>
    <LINE>How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;</LINE>
    <LINE>His coward lips did from their colour fly,</LINE>
    <LINE>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</LINE>
    <LINE>Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</LINE>
    <LINE>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</LINE>
    <LINE>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</LINE>
    <LINE>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</LINE>
    <LINE>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</LINE>
    <LINE>A man of such a feeble temper should</LINE>
    <LINE>So get the start of the majestic world</LINE>
    <LINE>And bear the palm alone.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <STAGEDIR>Shout. Flourish</STAGEDIR>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Another general shout!</LINE>
    <LINE>I do believe that these applauses are</LINE>
    <LINE>For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</LINE>
    <LINE>Like a Colossus, and we petty men</LINE>
    <LINE>Walk under his huge legs and peep about</LINE>
    <LINE>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</LINE>
    <LINE>Men at some time are masters of their fates:</LINE>
    <LINE>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</LINE>
    <LINE>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</LINE>
    <LINE>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?</LINE>
    <LINE>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</LINE>
    <LINE>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</LINE>
    <LINE>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</LINE>
    <LINE>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,</LINE>
    <LINE>Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.</LINE>
    <LINE>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</LINE>
    <LINE>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</LINE>
    <LINE>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</LINE>
    <LINE>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</LINE>
    <LINE>When went there by an age, since the great flood,</LINE>
    <LINE>But it was famed with more than with one man?</LINE>
    <LINE>When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,</LINE>
    <LINE>That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?</LINE>
    <LINE>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</LINE>
    <LINE>When there is in it but one only man.</LINE>
    <LINE>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</LINE>
    <LINE>There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd</LINE>
    <LINE>The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</LINE>
    <LINE>As easily as a king.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</LINE>
    <LINE>What you would work me to, I have some aim:</LINE>
    <LINE>How I have thought of this and of these times,</LINE>
    <LINE>I shall recount hereafter; for this present,</LINE>
    <LINE>I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</LINE>
    <LINE>Be any further moved. What you have said</LINE>
    <LINE>I will consider; what you have to say</LINE>
    <LINE>I will with patience hear, and find a time</LINE>
    <LINE>Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</LINE>
    <LINE>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</LINE>
    <LINE>Brutus had rather be a villager</LINE>
    <LINE>Than to repute himself a son of Rome</LINE>
    <LINE>Under these hard conditions as this time</LINE>
    <LINE>Is like to lay upon us.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I am glad that my weak words</LINE>
    <LINE>Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>The games are done and Caesar is returning.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;</LINE>
    <LINE>And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you</LINE>
    <LINE>What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <STAGEDIR>Re-enter CAESAR and his Train</STAGEDIR>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,</LINE>
    <LINE>The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,</LINE>
    <LINE>And all the rest look like a chidden train:</LINE>
    <LINE>Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero</LINE>
    <LINE>Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</LINE>
    <LINE>As we have seen him in the Capitol,</LINE>
    <LINE>Being cross'd in conference by some senators.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Casca will tell us what the matter is.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CAESAR</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Antonius!</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Caesar?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CAESAR</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Let me have men about me that are fat;</LINE>
    <LINE>Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:</LINE>
    <LINE>Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;</LINE>
    <LINE>He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;</LINE>
    <LINE>He is a noble Roman and well given.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CAESAR</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:</LINE>
    <LINE>Yet if my name were liable to fear,</LINE>
    <LINE>I do not know the man I should avoid</LINE>
    <LINE>So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;</LINE>
    <LINE>He is a great observer and he looks</LINE>
    <LINE>Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,</LINE>
    <LINE>As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;</LINE>
    <LINE>Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort</LINE>
    <LINE>As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit</LINE>
    <LINE>That could be moved to smile at any thing.</LINE>
    <LINE>Such men as he be never at heart's ease</LINE>
    <LINE>Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,</LINE>
    <LINE>And therefore are they very dangerous.</LINE>
    <LINE>I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd</LINE>
    <LINE>Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.</LINE>
    <LINE>Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,</LINE>
    <LINE>And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <STAGEDIR>Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA</STAGEDIR>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,</LINE>
    <LINE>That Caesar looks so sad.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, you were with him, were you not?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, there was a crown offered him: and being</LINE>
    <LINE>offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,</LINE>
    <LINE>thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>What was the second noise for?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, for that too.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, for that too.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Was the crown offered him thrice?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every</LINE>
    <LINE>time gentler than other, and at every putting-by</LINE>
    <LINE>mine honest neighbours shouted.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Who offered him the crown?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Why, Antony.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:</LINE>
    <LINE>it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark</LINE>
    <LINE>Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown</LINE>
    <LINE>neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told</LINE>
    <LINE>you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my</LINE>
    <LINE>thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he</LINE>
    <LINE>offered it to him again; then he put it by again:</LINE>
    <LINE>but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his</LINE>
    <LINE>fingers off it. And then he offered it the third</LINE>
    <LINE>time; he put it the third time by: and still as he</LINE>
    <LINE>refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their</LINE>
    <LINE>chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps</LINE>
    <LINE>and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and</LINE>
    <LINE>for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of</LINE>
    <LINE>opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at</LINE>
    <LINE>mouth, and was speechless.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,</LINE>
    <LINE>And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not</LINE>
    <LINE>clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and</LINE>
    <LINE>displeased them, as they use to do the players in</LINE>
    <LINE>the theatre, I am no true man.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>What said he when he came unto himself?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the</LINE>
    <LINE>common herd was glad he refused the crown, he</LINE>
    <LINE>plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his</LINE>
    <LINE>throat to cut. An I had been a man of any</LINE>
    <LINE>occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,</LINE>
    <LINE>I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so</LINE>
    <LINE>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,</LINE>
    <LINE>If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired</LINE>
    <LINE>their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three</LINE>
    <LINE>or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good</LINE>
    <LINE>soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but</LINE>
    <LINE>there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had</LINE>
    <LINE>stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>And after that, he came, thus sad, away?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Ay.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Did Cicero say any thing?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASCA</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Ay, he spoke Greek.</LINE>

    <LINE>one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own</LINE>
    <LINE>part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more</LINE>
    <LINE>news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs</LINE>

    <LINE>Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:</LINE>

    <LINE>Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,</LINE>
    <LINE>Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans</LINE>
    <LINE>Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:</LINE>
    <LINE>And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,</LINE>
    <LINE>And evils imminent; and on her knee</LINE>

  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>DECIUS BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>This dream is all amiss interpreted;</LINE>
    <LINE>It was a vision fair and fortunate:</LINE>
    <LINE>Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,</LINE>
    <LINE>In which so many smiling Romans bathed,</LINE>
    <LINE>Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck</LINE>
    <LINE>Reviving blood, and that great men shall press</LINE>
    <LINE>For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.</LINE>
    <LINE>This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.</LINE>

    <LINE>To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.</LINE>
    <LINE>If you shall send them word you will not come,</LINE>

  <SPEECH>

    <LINE>Cuts off so many years of fearing death.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Grant that, and then is death a benefit:</LINE>
    <LINE>So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged</LINE>
    <LINE>His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,</LINE>
    <LINE>And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood</LINE>
    <LINE>Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:</LINE>
    <LINE>Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,</LINE>
    <LINE>And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,</LINE>
    <LINE>Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'</LINE>

    <LINE>Ay, every man away:</LINE>
    <LINE>Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels</LINE>

  </SPEECH>
  <STAGEDIR>Enter a Servant</STAGEDIR>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:</LINE>
    <LINE>Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;</LINE>
    <LINE>And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:</LINE>
    <LINE>Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;</LINE>
    <LINE>Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:</LINE>
    <LINE>Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;</LINE>
    <LINE>Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.</LINE>
    <LINE>If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony</LINE>
    <LINE>May safely come to him, and be resolved</LINE>
    <LINE>How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,</LINE>
    <LINE>Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead</LINE>
    <LINE>So well as Brutus living; but will follow</LINE>
    <LINE>The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus</LINE>
    <LINE>Thorough the hazards of this untrod state</LINE>
    <LINE>With all true faith. So says my master Antony.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;</LINE>
    <LINE>I never thought him worse.</LINE>
    <LINE>Tell him, so please him come unto this place,</LINE>
    <LINE>He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,</LINE>
    <LINE>Depart untouch'd.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I'll fetch him presently.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I know that we shall have him well to friend.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I wish we may: but yet have I a mind</LINE>
    <LINE>That fears him much; and my misgiving still</LINE>
    <LINE>Falls shrewdly to the purpose.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>But here comes Antony.</LINE>
    <STAGEDIR>Re-enter ANTONY</STAGEDIR>
    <LINE>Welcome, Mark Antony.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?</LINE>
    <LINE>Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,</LINE>
    <LINE>Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.</LINE>
    <LINE>I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,</LINE>
    <LINE>Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:</LINE>
    <LINE>If I myself, there is no hour so fit</LINE>
    <LINE>As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument</LINE>
    <LINE>Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich</LINE>
    <LINE>With the most noble blood of all this world.</LINE>
    <LINE>I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,</LINE>
    <LINE>Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,</LINE>
    <LINE>Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,</LINE>
    <LINE>I shall not find myself so apt to die:</LINE>
    <LINE>No place will please me so, no mean of death,</LINE>
    <LINE>As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,</LINE>
    <LINE>The choice and master spirits of this age.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>O Antony, beg not your death of us.</LINE>
    <LINE>Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,</LINE>
    <LINE>As, by our hands and this our present act,</LINE>
    <LINE>You see we do, yet see you but our hands</LINE>
    <LINE>And this the bleeding business they have done:</LINE>
    <LINE>Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;</LINE>
    <LINE>And pity to the general wrong of Rome--</LINE>
    <LINE>As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--</LINE>
    <LINE>Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,</LINE>
    <LINE>To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:</LINE>
    <LINE>Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts</LINE>
    <LINE>Of brothers' temper, do receive you in</LINE>
    <LINE>With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Your voice shall be as strong as any man's</LINE>
    <LINE>In the disposing of new dignities.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Only be patient till we have appeased</LINE>
    <LINE>The multitude, beside themselves with fear,</LINE>
    <LINE>And then we will deliver you the cause,</LINE>
    <LINE>Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,</LINE>
    <LINE>Have thus proceeded.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I doubt not of your wisdom.</LINE>
    <LINE>Let each man render me his bloody hand:</LINE>
    <LINE>First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;</LINE>
    <LINE>Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;</LINE>
    <LINE>Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;</LINE>
    <LINE>Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;</LINE>
    <LINE>Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.</LINE>
    <LINE>Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?</LINE>
    <LINE>My credit now stands on such slippery ground,</LINE>
    <LINE>That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,</LINE>
    <LINE>Either a coward or a flatterer.</LINE>
    <LINE>That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:</LINE>
    <LINE>If then thy spirit look upon us now,</LINE>
    <LINE>Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,</LINE>
    <LINE>To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,</LINE>
    <LINE>Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,</LINE>
    <LINE>Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?</LINE>
    <LINE>Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,</LINE>
    <LINE>Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,</LINE>
    <LINE>It would become me better than to close</LINE>
    <LINE>In terms of friendship with thine enemies.</LINE>
    <LINE>Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;</LINE>
    <LINE>Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,</LINE>
    <LINE>Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.</LINE>
    <LINE>O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;</LINE>
    <LINE>And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.</LINE>
    <LINE>How like a deer, strucken by many princes,</LINE>
    <LINE>Dost thou here lie!</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Mark Antony,--</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Pardon me, Caius Cassius:</LINE>
    <LINE>The enemies of Caesar shall say this;</LINE>
    <LINE>Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I blame you not for praising Caesar so;</LINE>
    <LINE>But what compact mean you to have with us?</LINE>
    <LINE>Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;</LINE>
    <LINE>Or shall we on, and not depend on you?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,</LINE>
    <LINE>Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.</LINE>
    <LINE>Friends am I with you all and love you all,</LINE>
    <LINE>Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons</LINE>
    <LINE>Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Or else were this a savage spectacle:</LINE>
    <LINE>Our reasons are so full of good regard</LINE>
    <LINE>That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,</LINE>
    <LINE>You should be satisfied.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>That's all I seek:</LINE>
    <LINE>And am moreover suitor that I may</LINE>
    <LINE>Produce his body to the market-place;</LINE>
    <LINE>And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,</LINE>
    <LINE>Speak in the order of his funeral.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>You shall, Mark Antony.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Brutus, a word with you.</LINE>
    <STAGEDIR>Aside to BRUTUS</STAGEDIR>
    <LINE>You know not what you do: do not consent</LINE>
    <LINE>That Antony speak in his funeral:</LINE>
    <LINE>Know you how much the people may be moved</LINE>
    <LINE>By that which he will utter?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>By your pardon;</LINE>
    <LINE>I will myself into the pulpit first,</LINE>
    <LINE>And show the reason of our Caesar's death:</LINE>
    <LINE>What Antony shall speak, I will protest</LINE>
    <LINE>He speaks by leave and by permission,</LINE>
    <LINE>And that we are contented Caesar shall</LINE>
    <LINE>Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.</LINE>
    <LINE>It shall advantage more than do us wrong.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>I know not what may fall; I like it not.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.</LINE>
    <LINE>You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,</LINE>
    <LINE>But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,</LINE>
    <LINE>And say you do't by our permission;</LINE>
    <LINE>Else shall you not have any hand at all</LINE>
    <LINE>About his funeral: and you shall speak</LINE>
    <LINE>In the same pulpit whereto I am going,</LINE>
    <LINE>After my speech is ended.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Be it so.</LINE>
    <LINE>I do desire no more.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Prepare the body then, and follow us.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but ANTONY</STAGEDIR>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,</LINE>
    <LINE>That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!</LINE>
    <LINE>Thou art the ruins of the noblest man</LINE>
    <LINE>That ever lived in the tide of times.</LINE>
    <LINE>Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!</LINE>
    <LINE>Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--</LINE>
    <LINE>Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,</LINE>
    <LINE>To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--</LINE>
    <LINE>A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;</LINE>
    <LINE>Domestic fury and fierce civil strife</LINE>
    <LINE>Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;</LINE>
    <LINE>Blood and destruction shall be so in use</LINE>
    <LINE>And dreadful objects so familiar</LINE>
    <LINE>That mothers shall but smile when they behold</LINE>
    <LINE>Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;</LINE>
    <LINE>All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:</LINE>
    <LINE>And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,</LINE>
    <LINE>With Ate by his side come hot from hell,</LINE>
    <LINE>Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice</LINE>
    <LINE>Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;</LINE>
    <LINE>That this foul deed shall smell above the earth</LINE>
    <LINE>With carrion men, groaning for burial.</LINE>
    <STAGEDIR>Enter a Servant</STAGEDIR>
    <LINE>You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?</LINE>

    <LINE>I do, Mark Antony.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>He did receive his letters, and is coming;</LINE>
    <LINE>And bid me say to you by word of mouth--</LINE>

  </SPEECH>
  <STAGEDIR>Seeing the body</STAGEDIR>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.</LINE>
    <LINE>Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,</LINE>

    <LINE>Began to water. Is thy master coming?</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <SPEECH>
    <SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
    <LINE>He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>

    <LINE>Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:</LINE>
    <LINE>Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,</LINE>
    <LINE>No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;</LINE>
    <LINE>Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;</LINE>
    <LINE>Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse</LINE>
    <LINE>Into the market-place: there shall I try</LINE>
    <LINE>In my oration, how the people take</LINE>
    <LINE>The cruel issue of these bloody men;</LINE>
    <LINE>According to the which, thou shalt discourse</LINE>
    <LINE>To young Octavius of the state of things.</LINE>
    <LINE>Lend me your hand.</LINE>
  </SPEECH>
  <STAGEDIR>Exeunt with CAESAR's body</STAGEDIR>
